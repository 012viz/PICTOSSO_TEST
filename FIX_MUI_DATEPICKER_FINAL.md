# Fix: MUI DatePicker "views prop must contain at least one view" Error

## Date: November 1, 2025

## Problem
Error persisted even after previous fixes:
```
Error: MUI: The `views` prop must contain at least one view
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue had **multiple layers**:

1. **Layer 1 - ProjectEditor**: Dynamic imports with `ssr: false` prevented SSR issues ✅
2. **Layer 2 - DateField**: Guard checking `selectedPeriodType.value` ❌ **Not enough!**
3. **Layer 3 - Parent Components**: YourStory and LifeEvents were rendering **before** DateField's guard could execute ❌ **This was the real problem!**

### The Rendering Flow
```
page.tsx loads
  → ProjectChoice completes
    → ProjectEditor renders
      → YourStory/LifeEvents render (dynamic but still load)
        → DateField components render
          → getDatePickerViews(undefined) called
            → Returns empty array []
              → MUI DatePicker error! ❌
```

Even though DateField had a guard (`if (!selectedPeriodType.value) return null`), the JSX was **already being evaluated** with `views={getDatePickerViews(selectedPeriodType.value)}` **before** the guard could execute.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Guards in Parent Components

**YourStory/index.tsx:**
```typescript
const YourStory = () => {
    // CRITICAL: Don't render until selectedPeriodType is set
    if (!selectedPeriodType.value || !startDate.value || !endDate.value) {
        console.log('[YourStory] Waiting for signals to be initialized...');
        return (
            <div className="flex items-center justify-center h-full">
                <p className="text-gray-500">Loading...</p>
            </div>
        );
    }
    // ... rest of component
}
```

**LifeEvents/index.tsx:** Same guard added.

### 2. Defensive Programming in Helper Functions

**DateField.tsx:**
```typescript
const getDatePickerViews = (periodType: IPeriodType | undefined) => {
    // Always return at least one view to prevent MUI error
    let views: readonly DateView[] = ['year', 'month', 'day'] // Default
    
    if (!periodType) {
        return views; // Return default if periodType is undefined
    }
    // ... rest of function
}
```

This ensures that even if `periodType` is somehow undefined, we return a valid array instead of an empty one.

### 3. Double Guard in DateField

```typescript
const DatePickerComponent = (props: ...) => {
    // Don't render if period type is not set
    if (!selectedPeriodType.value) {
        console.log('[DatePicker] selectedPeriodType is not set, skipping render');
        return null;
    }

    // Extra safety check
    const views = getDatePickerViews(selectedPeriodType.value);
    if (!views || views.length === 0) {
        console.error('[DatePicker] No valid views calculated, skipping render');
        return null;
    }
    // ... rest of component
}
```

## Defense in Depth Strategy

We now have **4 layers of protection**:

1. **page.tsx** - Validates signals before closing ProjectChoice
2. **YourStory/LifeEvents** - Won't render until signals are ready
3. **DateField component** - Guards at start of component
4. **Helper functions** - Return safe defaults instead of empty arrays

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Navigate to /project → Should show ProjectChoice
- [ ] Select "Manual Creation" → Should show Step 1
- [ ] Complete Steps 1 & 2 → Should transition to editor without errors
- [ ] Select "AI Generation" → Generate a Pictosso
- [ ] Click "Apply" → Should transition to editor without errors
- [ ] Check browser console → Should see initialization logs, no MUI errors

## Files Modified

1. `/src/app/project/steps/YourStory/index.tsx` - Added initialization guard
2. `/src/app/project/steps/LifeEvents/index.tsx` - Added initialization guard  
3. `/src/app/project/steps/YourStory/DateField.tsx` - Enhanced guards and default returns

## Key Lesson

**React JSX evaluation happens before guards execute!**

When you write:
```tsx
{condition && <Component prop={someFunction()} />}
```

Even though `condition` is checked first, `someFunction()` in the props is **evaluated during JSX parsing**, before the component actually renders. This is why guards inside the component aren't enough - you need guards in the **parent** that decides whether to render the component at all.

## Prevention for Future

When creating components that depend on global state:
1. Always add guards in parent components that conditionally render
2. Make helper functions defensive (handle undefined gracefully)
3. Use TypeScript unions (`IPeriodType | undefined`) to make optionality explicit
4. Consider using React Suspense for async state loading
